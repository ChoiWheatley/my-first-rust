- src: https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/index.html
- objective: Learn rust with rust's well-known hardcore subject: "Why linked lists in rust hard?"
    - Learn my own data structures which supports self-referencing linked lists
    - Self instructing with high difficultiness
    - Learn about rust's strong type system and borrowing mechanism with lifetime indicator
    - Most important thing as learning is BE HONEST. freaking out because of compiler error doesn't make us productive.
